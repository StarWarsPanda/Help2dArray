#Introduction
Visit GitHub for download -> [GitHub](https://github.com/StarWarsPanda/BitCreate).

Welcome to the official documentation of BitCreate, a program to create 2d games on the TI-84 Plus CE!
This documentation will show you how to start a new project and eventually create your very own game!

##About BitCreate
This program is only a helpful tool to create games, and can be fully created with code in the TI Connect CE Program Editor.
 However, BitCreate makes it easier to create art and simplifies coding on a PC.
