#Starting a new project
Open up BitCreate and click New->Project.

 All sprite creation is handled by BitCreate, however, you have to create your own code!

##Start Coding
Let's start with a simple "Hello World"

    Start %Starts the program
    Background(255) %Refreshes the screen with a splash of white
    Repeat K=105 %Repeats until the enter key is pressed
    getKey %Gets the current keycode and sends it to variable K
    Text(0,0,0,255,1,1,Hello World) %Creates small text in black that says "Hello world"
    End
    Stop %Makes sure that the program safely stops
As you can see, it is pretty simple to create text and display it.

Next, let's explore how to display sprites
